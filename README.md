# The Royal Hotel Website

This project involved the creation of module to be used by an administrator of the hotel to add and amend resturant items offered for sale. 

The user can choose a current item from a drop down list to amend this item, for example if the price changed. Or they can create a new item, including a description of the item the price, and an image.

## Description

I used the Django framework to create this project, and styled it using CSS.
