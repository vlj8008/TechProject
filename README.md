# The Royal Hotel Website


[Royal Hotels.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73119731/202062598-5e25f69c-9235-444a-a18c-78a2ad043798.webm)

This project involved the creation of module to be used by an administrator of the hotel to add and amend resturant items offered for sale. 

The user can choose a current item from a drop down list to amend this item, for example if the price changed. Or they can create a new item, including a description of the item the price, and an image.

## Description

I used the Django framework to create this project, and styled it using CSS.
